Resume

Designed and built this full responsive webpage for my Resume, using HTML5 markup and CSS3 cascading styles sheet. The version control for this webpage was managed using Git with it's repository residing on GitHub.

The plan was to deploy the page using GitHub page but I wanted to try something new. So it was deployed using Netlify.

Each menu button is clickable and will take you to the relevant section of the CV. If you hover over the menu button, you will experience a very subtle set of different 'effects' that brings each button 'alive' and make user experience of the webpage more exciting.

Enjoy ![smile](image.png)!
